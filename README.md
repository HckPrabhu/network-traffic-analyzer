# network-traffic-analyzer
"Real-time network traffic analyzer with intrusion detection, built using Python and Flask."


## üöß Project Status  
**This project is under active development.**  
- Core features (packet capture, basic IDS) are functional.  
- Expect breaking changes as new features are added.  
- Documentation and testing are incomplete.


# üåê Real-Time Network Traffic Analyzer with Intrusion Detection  
![Dashboard Demo](./screenshots/dashboard-demo.gif)  
*Monitor, detect, and visualize network threats in real time.*  

---

## üöÄ Features  
- **Live Packet Capture**: Analyze HTTP, TCP/UDP, and DNS traffic using Scapy.  
- **Custom IDS Rules**: Detect SYN floods, port scans, and suspicious payloads.  
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize traffic patterns with Flask and Matplotlib.  
- **Real-Time Alerts**: SMS/Email notifications via Twilio (optional).  
- **SQLite Logging**: Store and query historical traffic data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.9+  
- Admin privileges (for packet capture)  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HckPrabhu/network-traffic-analyzer.git
cd network-traffic-analyzer

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage  

### Step 1: Start Packet Capture  
```bash
# Terminal 1 (requires admin rights for raw socket access)
sudo python analyzer/packet_analyzer.py
```

### Step 2: Launch Dashboard  
```bash
# Terminal 2
python analyzer/dashboard/app.py
```
Access the dashboard at: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)  

---

### üéØ Simulating Attacks  
Test the IDS with these scenarios:  

1. **Port Scan**  
   ```bash
   nmap -sS localhost
   ```

2. **SYN Flood** (install `hping3` first)  
   ```bash
   sudo hping3 -S -p 80 --flood 127.0.0.1
   ```

3. **Malicious Payload**  
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost -H "User-Agent: cmd.exe"
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è IDS Rules Implemented  
| Threat Type          | Detection Method                          | Threshold           |  
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|  
| Port Scanning        | SYN packets to multiple closed ports      | >15 SYN packets/sec |  
| DDoS Attack          | High traffic volume from a single IP      | >1000 packets/sec   |  
| Suspicious Payload   | Keywords like `cmd.exe` in HTTP headers   | Exact string match  |

## üîå Enabling Twilio Alerts  
1. Create a free [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).  
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add your credentials:  
   ```ini
   TWILIO_SID=your_account_sid
   TWILIO_TOKEN=your_auth_token
   TWILIO_PHONE=+1234567890  # Your Twilio phone number
   ALERT_PHONE=+0987654321   # Your personal phone number
   ```  
3. Uncomment the Twilio code in `packet_analyzer.py`.
